Wordpress dynamic image resizer
==
This is fork of Wordpress plugin by Samuel Wood (Otto) located in [Wordpress repository](http://wordpress.org/plugins/dynamic-image-resizer/).

There are few bugs fixed as the original plugin is no longer in developement.

Main purpose of this plugin is ability to use lots of add_image_size() WP image sizes without messing with filesystem. This is usefull in case, where you need many different image sizes and only few images will be shown in specific sizes. So there is no need to resize all WP images to that dimensions. This is especially usefull with responsive image solutions like Picturefill etc. Hope that makes sense.
