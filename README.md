Wordpress dynamic image resizer
==
This is fork of Wordpress plugin by Samuel Wood (Otto) located in [Wordpress repository](http://wordpress.org/plugins/dynamic-image-resizer/).

There are few bugs fixed as the original plugin is no longer in developement.

Main purpose of this plugin is ability to use lot's of add_image_size() WP sizes without messing with filesystem. This is usefull in case, that you need many different image sizes, where only few images will be shown in that size. So there is no need to resize all WP images to that dimensions. This is especially usefull with responsive image solutions like Picturefill etc. Hope that makes sense.
